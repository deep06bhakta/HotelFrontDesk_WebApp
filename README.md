# How to Create an AWS Account

Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a robust cloud computing platform, and creating an AWS account is the first step to leverage its services. Follow the steps below to set up your AWS account:


## 1. Navigate to the AWS Sign-Up Page

Visit the AWS sign-up page by entering the following URL into your web browser: [AWS Sign-Up](https://aws.amazon.com/). Look for the "Sign Up" button on the top right corner of the page and click on it.

## 2. Provide your Email Address

Enter a valid email address that you will use for your AWS account. This email will be associated with the account and used for communication from AWS.

## 3. Enter Account Information

Fill in the required information, including your name, company name (if applicable), and a secure password. Make sure to choose a strong password to enhance the security of your AWS account.

## 4. Contact Information Verification

AWS will ask you to enter your contact number. Provide a valid phone number as AWS may use it for security purposes. You will receive a verification code on this number.

## 5. Enter Payment Information

To access certain AWS services, you need to provide payment information. AWS offers a free tier with limited resources for the first 12 months, but you'll still need to enter payment details.

## 6. Verify your Identity

To enhance security, AWS may ask for additional identity verification. This may include entering a CAPTCHA or using a multi-factor authentication (MFA) device.

## 7. Choose a Support Plan

Select a support plan based on your preferences. AWS offers various plans, including a free plan with basic support.

## 8. Complete Sign-Up

Review your information, agree to the terms and conditions, and click on the "Create Account and Continue" button to complete the sign-up process.

## 9. Account Activation

You will receive an email from AWS asking you to confirm your email address. Click on the confirmation link provided in the email to activate your AWS account.

**Congratulations!** You have successfully created an AWS account. You can now log in to the AWS Management Console and start exploring the wide range of cloud services offered by AWS.
